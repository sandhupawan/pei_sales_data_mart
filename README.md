## 🧠 Assumptions Made

1. **Customers Table**
   - `age` must be greater than 0 and less than 120.
   - `first_name` and `last_name` should not contain numbers or special characters.
   - `customer_id` is unique and cannot have duplicates.
   - A person with the same `first_name`, `last_name`, and `age` can exist in the same country as long as the `customer_id` is unique.

2. **Orders Table**
   - `amount` should always be greater than 0.
   - `order_id` must be unique.
   - A customer can order the same item for the same amount more than once; hence uniqueness is enforced only on `order_id`.

3. **Shipping Table**
   - There’s no direct link between `shipping` and `orders`; `shipping_status` is treated as a dimension.
   - A customer can only have either **Delivered** or **Pending** status. More than one entry per customer with either status will be considered a duplicate.
   - Not all customers have shipping data.

4. **General**
   - Not all customers have order data.
